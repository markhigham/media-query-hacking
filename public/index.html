        <h1>Is she dead, yes or no?</h1>
        <p>
          The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities
          of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the
          name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley
          of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
          lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance
          and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My
          brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My
          vengeance upon thee.
        </p>

        <h1>I'm serious as a heart attack</h1>
        <p>
          Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag
          clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little
          Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
          mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No?
          Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
          a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
        </p>

        <h1>I gotta piss</h1>
        <p>
          My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit
          about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm
          gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that
          bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna
          tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker.
          You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is
          in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?
        </p>

        <h1>Hold on to your butts</h1>
        <p>
          Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to
          bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do.
          That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same
          way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our
          lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and
          I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
        </p>

        <h1>Hold on to your butts</h1>
        <p>
          You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a
          mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for
          murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I
          don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven
          of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
          oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that
          killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't
          hold a candle to man.
        </p>

        <h1>I gotta piss</h1>
        <p>
          Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It
          all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the
          arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And
          most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way
          back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me
          Mr Glass.

        <h1>Are you ready for the truth?</h1>
        <p>
          Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but
          you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I
          don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this
          case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too
          much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb
          ass.
